# Next Maps App

This project is a Next.js application that integrates Google Maps with data fetched from a Supabase database. It displays a full-screen map centered on Nigeria, with markers representing data points from the "responses" table.

## Features

- Full-screen Google Map integration using `@react-google-maps/api`.
- Fetches data from Supabase and displays markers with InfoWindows.
- Handles loading and error states gracefully.
- Basic clustering of markers for large datasets.
